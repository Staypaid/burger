# Burger-app
This app uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM

I deployed my app to Heroku for web hosting https://thawing-beyond-18157.herokuapp.com/

I followed the MVC design pattern, used Node and MySQL to query and route data, and I used Handlebars to generate HTML.

Eat-da-burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they’d like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger’s name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page — waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area is ready to be picked up. When you press the dollar-sign button the burger passes to the pick up section in the right side of the website.

When you press the red button the burger is being devoured thus it dissapears from the view. 

The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
