# Burger-app
This app uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM

I deployed my app to Heroku for web hosting https://kingburger100.herokuapp.com/

King Burger 100 is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they’d like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger’s name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page — waiting to be devoured.

Like a virtual restaurant, each burger in the waiting area is ready to be picked up. When you press the dollar-sign button the burger passes to the pick up section in the right side of the website.

The red button acts as the guest after food has been dropped off, devouring the burger and causing it to dissapear from the view. 

The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
